    q: "How is OnchainSuite different from Mailchimp or Klaviyo?",

  },
  {
    q: "Do my users need to share an email to be reachable?",
    a: "No. The wallet is the identity. In-app push reaches 100% of connected wallets with no extra identifier. Email, Telegram, and other channels are added lazily and only when available — a wallet with zero linked channels is still a valid contact.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which blockchains and protocols are supported?",
    a: "Ethereum, Solana, Base, and Polygon at launch, tracking protocols like Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Jupiter, Marinade, Aerodrome, and QuickSwap. The Protocol Normalization System standardizes events so they look the same across every chain and protocol.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can I see value?",
    a: "Under 10 minutes. Connect your contract addresses, OnchainSuite auto-indexes the last 90 days of normalized events, and an auto-generated cohort report appears before you build a single campaign.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle privacy and GDPR?",
    a: "Wallet addresses are public and indexed directly. Personal identifiers (email, FID, social handles) are bridged via zero-knowledge proofs and stored off-chain in deletable storage, consent-gated, with a documented erasure workflow — GDPR-compliant by architecture.",

    q: "What does it cost?",
