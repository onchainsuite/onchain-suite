# CLAUDE.md — Frontend rendering & engineering guide

This file guides anyone (humans or AI agents) editing the OnchainSuite frontend.
Its job is to push the codebase toward **world-class production rendering
performance** and **maintainable frontend engineering**.

Scope right now: **rendering speed + frontend architecture only**. Do NOT make
design/visual decisions — the team hasn't finalized design. Keep existing
visuals; change *how* things render, not *how they look*. When a change forces a
visual choice, keep it minimal and theme-token based, and call it out.

## 0. Standing directives

1. Implement the latest API endpoints from `docs/backend.md`; model typed
   request/response contracts, never `any`.
2. Reduce frontend render time as much as possible — this whole document is how.
3. Model the domain **wallet-first** (Section 0.5). It's the product standard,
   shared with the backend; UI/data contracts must conform.

---

## 0.5 Product data contracts (wallet-first — shared standard)

Mirrors the backend `CLAUDE.md` Section 2.5. These are product invariants; the
frontend consumes and must not contradict them.

1. **Wallet is the identity.** Type a contact around `walletAddress` as the primary
   key; `email`, `farcaster`/FID, `x`, `ens`, `telegram`, `discord` are optional
   **channel handles** (`{ value, source, verifiedAt, optInAt }`). A wallet with
   zero channels is valid — never gate UI (forms, tables, selection) on an email
   existing, and never send an empty email as required.
2. **Channel-aware reachability.** "reachable on in-app push" ≠ "has email". Model
   reachability per channel in audience/segment builders; don't assume email.
3. **Never render PII from plaintext assumptions.** Email/FID/X/Discord are PII and
   are blind-indexed/encrypted server-side. Display only what the API returns
   (decrypted at the boundary); don't build client-side joins/dedup on raw email —
   use the server's contact id / wallet.
4. **Multi-channel, one trigger.** The automation builder's send nodes are siblings
   — `{ Send Email, Send In-App Push, Post to Discord, Post to Telegram, Post to
   Farcaster }` — over a shared trigger/segment contract. Per-channel analytics
   differ (email: Sent/Delivered/Opened/Clicked; in-app: Delivered/Viewed/
   Dismissed/Clicked; posts: Posted/Reactions/Replies) — type them separately.
5. **Protocol Plays** are versioned specs the user forks into an editable
   automation; render the gallery by tier (Starter first) with "Ready to fork" vs
   "Needs setup" from the Play's tier/gate. First-mile shows an auto-generated
   cohort insight with a no-email CTA ("reach these wallets with an in-app push").

## 1. Golden rules (read first)

1. **Server Components by default.** Add `"use client"` only when a file needs
   state, effects, refs, browser APIs, or event handlers. Push client boundaries
   as far down the tree as possible (leaf, not page).
2. **Render only what's visible.** Paginate or virtualize anything that can grow
   past ~100 rows/items. Never map thousands of nodes into the DOM.
3. **Fetch once, cache, don't re-fetch on focus/reconnect.** The shared
   `QueryClient`/`SWRConfig` defaults already enforce this — keep it that way.
4. **Every async op is bounded.** Long/agentic calls (MCP, enrichment, streams)
   must have a timeout and an abort path. No request may hang forever.
5. **Stable references.** Memoize derived data and callbacks that feed memoized
   children, effect deps, or query keys. Don't allocate new objects/arrays in
   render that become dependencies.
6. **Measure before and after.** Use the React Profiler / Web Vitals; don't
   guess. A change "for perf" without a number is a maybe.
7. **Type the boundary.** One typed service per API family; unwrap the
   `{ success, data }` envelope once, in the service — components consume typed
   data.

## 2. Rendering model (RSC, client boundaries, streaming)

- **Default to Server Components** for pages, layouts, and static/presentational
  subtrees. They ship zero JS and render data on the server.
- **`"use client"` is a cost.** Everything it imports ships to the browser. A
  client page that renders 20 static sections is 20 sections of needless JS.
  Extract the interactive bit into a small client component and keep the rest
  server-rendered.
- **Co-locate the boundary.** Prefer `Parent(server) → InteractiveChild(client)`
  over making the whole page client just for one button.
- **Stream with Suspense.** Wrap slow data regions in `<Suspense>` with a
  skeleton so the shell paints immediately. Don't block the whole route on the
  slowest query.
- **`loading.tsx` / `error.tsx`** per route segment for instant feedback and
  resilient failures.
- **Never import server-only code into client files** (and vice versa). Keep
  service modules isomorphic or clearly split.

## 3. Data fetching & caching

- **React Query is the default** for server state. Conventions:
  - Query keys are arrays, hierarchical, and include every input:
    `["intelligence","query", queryId, "results", { page, limit }]`.
  - The app sets sane global defaults (`refetchOnWindowFocus: false`,
    `refetchOnReconnect: false`, `staleTime`, `retry: 1`) in
    `src/shared/providers/root-providers.tsx` and the dashboard `QueryClient`.
    Inherit them; only override per-query with a reason.
  - `enabled` to gate dependent queries; never fire with missing inputs.
  - Mutations: `onSuccess` invalidates the minimal set of keys. Use optimistic
    updates for snappy UX, with rollback in `onError`.
- **One service layer per domain** (`*.service.ts`). It owns URLs, headers
  (`x-org-id`), envelope unwrapping, and typed responses. Example pattern:
  `features/intelligence/intelligence.service.ts`. Components never call axios
  directly.
- **Parallelize, don't waterfall.** Independent requests run with
  `Promise.all` / parallel queries — not awaited one after another.
- **Debounce user-driven fetches** (search, audience estimate) ~300–400ms; see
  `features/campaigns/.../audience-step.tsx`.
- **SWR** is used for a few org-level reads — same discipline: focus/reconnect
  revalidation off, dedupe interval set (see the global `SWRConfig`).
- **Bound long calls.** Pass `signal` (AbortController) and a `timeout` to
  agentic/streaming requests; expose a Stop control. The MCP query in
  `intelligence.service.ts` / `query/index.tsx` is the reference.
- **Don't store server data in component state** when a query can own it (avoids
  duplicate sources of truth and extra renders).

## 4. Rendering data fast (lists, tables, grids)

- **Paginate at the source.** Request `page`/`limit`; render a page, not a
  dataset. Backends cap rows (e.g. SQL results cap at 500) — respect it.
- **Virtualize large/variable lists.** Add **`@tanstack/react-virtual`** (not
  currently installed) for any list/table that can exceed a screen — render only
  rows in view. Mandatory for results grids, audience tables, long histories.
- **Derive with `useMemo`.** Compute columns, filtered/sorted rows, totals once
  per input change — not every render. Heavy transforms belong in memos or the
  service, not inline JSX.
- **Stable, meaningful `key`s** (entity id), never array index for dynamic
  lists — index keys cause remount churn and state bugs.
- **Avoid inline allocation in hot render paths.** No `style={{...}}`,
  `onClick={() => ...}` recreated per row for thousands of rows when it can be
  hoisted or memoized.
- **Format on demand.** `toLocaleString`/date formatting is not free at scale —
  memoize formatters; format only visible rows.
- **Cap visible columns/data** like the SQL table does (`columns.slice(0, 8)`),
  with "show more" affordances rather than dumping everything.
- **Empty/loading/error states** are first-class — render skeletons, not blank
  layout shifts.

## 5. Icons (fast, no bloat)

- **Heroicons, per-icon named imports only** — this is tree-shaken:
  `import { BoltIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline"`. This is already the
  convention; keep it.
- **Never build a dynamic "all icons" map/registry** or `import * as Icons` — it
  defeats tree-shaking and ships the whole set. Map your own string→component
  lookups explicitly with only the icons you use.
- **`currentColor` + Tailwind text color** for theming; don't hardcode icon
  fills. Set explicit `h-/w-` so icons never cause layout shift (CLS).
- **`aria-hidden="true"`** on decorative icons; label the interactive element,
  not the glyph.
- For **very large icon counts** in one view (e.g. a chain/token picker),
  prefer a single SVG **sprite** (`<use href="#id">`) or lazy-load the icon
  module, instead of dozens of React icon components mounting at once.
- Don't wrap every icon in `motion.*`; animate the container, not each SVG.

## 6. Re-render hygiene

- **Split components** so state changes re-render the smallest subtree. A giant
  component (e.g. a 3000-line query view) re-renders everything on every
  keystroke — extract the input, the results table, the chat thread, etc.
- **`React.memo`** leaf/presentational components that receive stable props.
  Pair with `useCallback`/`useMemo` for the props you pass them.
- **Colocate state** with where it's used; lift only when shared. Avoid putting
  fast-changing state (input text, scroll) high in the tree.
- **Context**: a context value that changes often re-renders all consumers.
  Split contexts by update frequency, or pass setters (stable) separately from
  values.
- **Don't pass new object/array literals** as props/deps unless memoized.
- Prefer **uncontrolled inputs** (or local state + debounce) for text fields in
  large forms; controlled + global state on every keystroke is a re-render tax.

## 7. Code-splitting & bundle size

- **`next/dynamic`** (with `ssr: false` when client-only) for heavy, below-the-
  fold, or rarely-used modules: **ReactFlow** (automation builder),
  **Recharts** (report charts), rich editors, anything pulling large deps.
- **framer-motion** is heavy — load it only where used; prefer CSS transitions
  for simple hovers/reveals (see the landing's CSS-driven reveals). Don't import
  `motion` into otherwise-static components.
- **Avoid barrel files that re-export everything** (`index.ts` exporting a whole
  feature) on hot paths — they can pull unrelated code into a chunk. Import from
  the specific module.
- **Watch import cost.** Before adding a dependency, check its size and whether a
  platform primitive (Intl, URL, fetch, CSS) already does the job.
- Run the **bundle analyzer** when adding/upgrading deps; keep route JS lean.

## 8. Images, fonts, media

- **`next/image`** for all raster images — automatic sizing, lazy-load,
  responsive `srcset`. Always set `width`/`height` (or `fill` + sized parent) to
  avoid CLS. Add remote hosts to `next.config.ts`.
- **`next/font`** (already used in `app/layout.tsx`) for self-hosted, swap-free
  fonts. Don't add `<link>` Google Fonts.
- **Canvas/animation backdrops** must cap DPR, scale work to viewport, and pause
  when offscreen/hidden or under `prefers-reduced-motion` (see the landing hero
  canvas as the reference implementation).

## 9. Forms, inputs, interactions

- **react-hook-form + zod** for forms — uncontrolled by default, minimal
  re-renders, schema validation. Use `useWatch` for targeted subscriptions
  instead of `watch()` re-rendering the whole form.
- **Debounce/throttle** expensive change handlers (search, live estimates,
  autosave). Cancel in-flight requests when inputs change (sequence ref or
  abort).
- Keep keypress handlers cheap; defer heavy work to `requestIdleCallback` or a
  memoized effect.

## 10. Perceived performance

- **Skeletons over spinners** for content regions; reserve layout to avoid CLS.
- **Optimistic UI** for mutations that usually succeed (status toggles,
  deletes), with rollback.
- **Stream/Suspense** so the shell is interactive before data lands.
- Show progress for long ops (enrichment status polling, MCP stream activity);
  always offer a Stop/cancel.

## 11. Pitfalls we've already hit (don't regress)

- **Refetch storms:** focus/reconnect refetch was hammering the API (429s). It's
  off globally — don't re-enable per-query without cause.
- **Unbounded agent calls:** MCP "ran forever" with no timeout. All
  long/streaming calls need timeout + abort + a Stop button.
- **Envelope shape:** responses are `{ success, data }`; unwrap once in the
  service. Map backend field names exactly (e.g. SQL columns are
  `{ key, label }`, not `name`).
- **Hardcoded theme colors:** don't bake `bg-[#…]` / `rgba(...)` darks into
  components — use Tailwind **semantic tokens** (`bg-card`, `bg-muted`,
  `border-border`, `text-foreground`) so light/dark both work.
- **Giant client components** re-rendering on every keystroke — split them.

## 12. Quality gates & tooling

- **TypeScript is the contract.** `next.config.ts` currently sets
  `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` — that hides real breakage. Treat type
  errors as build failures: run `npx tsc --noEmit` and keep it green; the goal
  is to remove that flag.
- **Lint** (`eslint`) clean — unused imports/vars inflate bundles and signal
  dead code.
- **Measure:** React DevTools Profiler for re-renders; Lighthouse / Web Vitals
  (LCP, INP, CLS) for the route; `@next/bundle-analyzer` for chunk size.
- **Targets:** LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 on key dashboard routes.

## 13. PR / change checklist

- [ ] Is this component a Server Component? If `"use client"`, is the boundary as
      small as possible?
- [ ] Any list/table that can grow — is it paginated or virtualized?
- [ ] New data fetch — typed service method, correct query key, inherits caching
      defaults, parallel (not waterfall)?
- [ ] Long/async op — timeout + abort + cancel UI?
- [ ] Derived data memoized; callbacks stable; keys are entity ids?
- [ ] Icons: per-import, `currentColor`, fixed size, no dynamic icon registry?
- [ ] Heavy dep (chart/flow/editor/motion) dynamically imported?
- [ ] Colors use semantic tokens (light + dark both work)?
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` clean; lint clean; profiled if perf-sensitive?
